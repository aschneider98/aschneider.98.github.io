        <p>Hi, I'm Alex Schneider and I am a Geography student at The Ohio State University. I am specializing in Spatial Analysis, and I really enjoy the Cartographic aspects of GIS. I'm also very interested in science and technology, and would like to get better at coding. After graduating this upcoming May, I would like to work as a Geospatial Analyst, or maybe as a mapping specialist for a tech company. I am currently a research assistant using satellite imagery to classify powerplant cooling techonologies. In my free time I like to invest in the stock market, play ice or roller hockey (depending on the weather), and play video games with friends.</p>
