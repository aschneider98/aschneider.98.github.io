        <p>Hi, I'm Alex Schneider and I am a Geography student at The Ohio State University specializing in Spatial Analysis. I'm very interested in science and technology, and I'm working on getting better at coding. After graduating this upcoming May, I would like to work as a Geospatial Analyst, or maybe as a mapping specialist for a tech company. I am currently a research assistant using satellite imagery to classify powerplant cooling technologies. In my free time I like to invest in the stock market, play ice or roller hockey (depending on the weather), and play video games with friends.</p>
